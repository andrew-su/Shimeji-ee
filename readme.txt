Shimeji English Enhanced

Shimeji is a Windows desktop mascot that freely wanders and plays around the screen.  The mascot is very configurable; its actions are defined through xml and its animations/images can be customized.  Shimeji was originally created by Yuki Yamada of Group Finity (http://www.group-finity.com/Shimeji/).  This branch of the original Shimeji project not only translates the program/source to English, but aims to additionally enhance Shimeji as well.
